I will attempt to create a moon. the moon will be rotaraing, as it rotaes, 
the shadows and hihglights will change just like it does when it rotates
around the Earth.

For this project I will use Three.js

for the next week, I will try to make the rotating sphere

the following week I will try to make the rotaion interactive so depending how the 
user rotates it, the shadows and lighting will be changed accordingly.
